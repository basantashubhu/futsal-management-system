						<b>The $20 Spay &amp; Neuter Program</b> is brought to you by the Delaware Division of Public Healthâ€™s Office of Animal
						Welfare. Spay and neuter services are provided by licensed veterinarians located throughout the state. The Spay &amp;
						Neuter Program provides low-cost spay and neuter services to cats and dogs of income-eligible applicants. Those who
						are eligible may have up to two pets spayed or neutered every fiscal year for $20 each. A free rabies vaccine is included;
						it is the law to have your animal vaccinated against rabies. This partnership helps all of us work toward the day when
						every cat and dog is wanted, safe, and unharmed.</div>
					<div class="clear">Note: Funding is limited. Applications are processed on a first-come, first-served basis, as funding allows. Applicants
						may expect to receive a response via mail

						<br />
						<b>Spay</b> is a term to describe the removal of the ovaries and uterus from a female animal.
						<br />
						<b>Neuter</b> is a term to describe the removal of the testicles from a male animal.</div>
					<div class="clear">
						<img class="aboutSide" src="{{ asset('img/uploads/2015/06/aboutSide3.png') }}" alt="aboutSide3" />Once an animal is spayed or neutered, that animal is no longer able to reproduce. Female cats can become pregnant as
						young as 4 months old and female dogs can become pregnant as young as 5 months old. Both cats and dogs are able to
						produce multiple litters per year. An owner of one female cat or dog can quickly become overwhelmed by kittens or puppies
						in just a matter of a few months. Not only will spaying or neutering your pets eliminate unwanted puppies or kittens
						in your own home, it will also reduce pet homelessness and the number of animals that enter shelters in Delaware and
						may face euthanasia.</div>
